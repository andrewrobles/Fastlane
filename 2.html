Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?<br>
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,<br>
“Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.”<br>
He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.<br>
Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,<br>
“As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.”<br>
I will tell of the decree: The Lord said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.<br>
Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.<br>
You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”<br>
Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.<br>
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.<br>
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.<br>
