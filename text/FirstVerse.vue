Uh, first verse, uh<br>
I'm armed/on 'til I'm on a island<br>
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot<br>
Before I touch dirt I kill y'all with kindness<br>
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse<br>
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform<br>
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform<br>
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on<br>
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn<br>
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know<br>
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'<br>
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole<br>
Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow<br>
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke<br>
Though I ain't wrapped tight<br>
My blood type's the '80s!<br>
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys<br>
You still fly kites daily!<br>
