My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit<br>
At war with a bottle, as Captain Morgan attacks my organs<br>
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins<br>
I made a pact with the Devil that says "I'll let you take me<br>
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"<br>
Go back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in<br>
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down<br>
My tenement, chimney now; the semi’s the remedy, pow<br>
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity—<br>
