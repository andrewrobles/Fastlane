Livin' life in the fast lane<br>
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down<br>
Only got a gallon in the gas tank<br>
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now<br>
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride<br>
Gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die<br>
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)<br>
Livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)<br>
