LORD our Lord,<br>
How excellent is thy name in all the earth!<br>
Who hast set thy glory above the heavens.<br>
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength<br>
Because of thine enemies,<br>
That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.<br>
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,<br>
The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;<br>
What is man, that thou art mindful of him?<br>
And the son of man, that thou visitest him?<br>
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,<br>
And hast crowned him with glory and honour.<br>
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;<br>
Thou hast put all things under his feet:<br>
All sheep and oxen,<br>
Yea, and the beasts of the field;<br>
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,<br>
And whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.<br>
O LORD our Lord,<br>
How excellent is thy name in all the earth!<br>
