LORD, how are they increased that trouble me!<br>
Many are they that rise up against me.<br>
Many there be which say of my soul,<br>
There is no help for him in God.<br>
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me;<br>
My glory, and the lifter up of mine head.<br>
I cried unto the LORD with my voice,<br>
And he heard me out of his holy hill.<br>
I laid me down and slept;<br>
I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.<br>
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,<br>
That have set themselves against me round about.<br>
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God:<br>
For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone;<br>
Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.<br>
Salvation belongeth unto the LORD:<br>
Thy blessing is upon thy people.<br>
