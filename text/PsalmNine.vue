I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart;<br>
I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.<br>
I will be glad and rejoice in thee:<br>
I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.<br>
When mine enemies are turned back,<br>
They shall fall and perish at thy presence.<br>
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause;<br>
Thou satest in the throne judging right.<br>
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,<br>
Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.<br>
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end:<br>
And thou hast destroyed cities;<br>
Their memorial is perished with them.<br>
But the LORD shall endure for ever:<br>
He hath prepared his throne for judgment.<br>
And he shall judge the world in righteousness,<br>
He shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.<br>
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed,<br>
A refuge in times of trouble.<br>
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee:<br>
For thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.<br>
Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion:<br>
Declare among the people his doings.<br>
When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them:<br>
He forgetteth not the cry of the humble.<br>
Have mercy upon me, O LORD;<br>
Consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me,<br>
Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:<br>
That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion:<br>
I will rejoice in thy salvation.<br>
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made:<br>
In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.<br>
The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth:<br>
The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.<br>
The wicked shall be turned into hell,<br>
And all the nations that forget God.<br>
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten:<br>
The expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.<br>
Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail:<br>
Let the heathen be judged in thy sight.<br>
Put them in fear, O LORD:<br>
That the nations may know themselves to be but men.<br>
