O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger,<br>
Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.<br>
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak:<br>
O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.<br>
My soul is also sore vexed:<br>
But thou, O LORD, how long?<br>
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul:<br>
Oh save me for thy mercies' sake.<br>
For in death there is no remembrance of thee:<br>
In the grave who shall give thee thanks?<br>
I am weary with my groaning;<br>
All the night make I my bed to swim;<br>
I water my couch with my tears.<br>
Mine eye is consumed because of grief;<br>
It waxeth old because of all mine enemies.<br>
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;<br>
For the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.<br>
The LORD hath heard my supplication;<br>
The LORD will receive my prayer.<br>
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed:<br>
Let them return and be ashamed suddenly.<br>
