Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness:<br>
Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress;<br>
Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.<br>
O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?<br>
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself:<br>
The LORD will hear when I call unto him.<br>
Stand in awe, and sin not:<br>
Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.<br>
Offer the sacrifices of righeousness,<br>
And put your trust in the LORD.<br>
There be many that say, Who will show us any good?<br>
LORD lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.<br>
Thou hast put gladness in my heart,<br>
More than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.<br>
I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep:<br>
For thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.<br>
