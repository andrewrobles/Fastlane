O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust:<br>
Save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:<br>
Lest he tear my soul like a lion,<br>
Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.<br>
O LORD my God, if I have done this;<br>
If there be iniquity in my hands;<br>
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;<br>
(Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)<br>
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it;<br>
Yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth,<br>
And lay mine honour in the dust.<br>
Arise, O LORD, in thine anger,<br>
Lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies:<br>
And awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.<br>
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:<br>
For their sakes therefore return thou on high.<br>
The LORD shall judge the people:<br>
Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness,<br>
And according to mine integrity that is in me.<br>
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end;<br>
But establish the just:<br>
For the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.<br>
My defence is of God,<br>
Which saveth the upright in heart.<br>
God judgeth the righteous,<br>
And God is angry with the wicked every day.<br>
If he turn not, he will whet his sword;<br>
He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.<br>
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;<br>
He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.<br>
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity,<br>
And hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<br>
He made a pit, and digged it,<br>
And is fallen into the ditch which he made.<br>
His mischief shall return upon his own head,<br>
And his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.<br>
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness:<br>
And will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.<br>
