Give ear to my words, O LORD,<br>
Consider my meditation.<br>
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God:<br>
For unto thee will I pray.<br>
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD;<br>
In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.<br>
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:<br>
Neither shall evil dwell with thee.<br>
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight:<br>
Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.<br>
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing:<br>
The LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.<br>
But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy:<br>
And in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.<br>
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;<br>
Make thy way straight before my face.<br>
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;<br>
Their inward part is very wickedness;<br>
Their throat is an open sepulchre;<br>
They flatter with their tongue.<br>
Destroy thou them, O God;<br>
Let them fall by their own counsels;<br>
Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions;<br>
For they have rebelled against thee.<br>
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice:<br>
Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:<br>
Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.<br>
For thou, LORD, wilst bless the righteous;<br>
With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.<br>
