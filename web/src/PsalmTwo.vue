Why do the heathen rage,<br>
And the people imagine a vain thing?<br>
The kings of the earth set themselves,<br>
And the rulers take counsel together,<br>
Against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,<br>
Let us break their bands asunder,<br>
And cast away their cords from us.<br>
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:<br>
The LORD shall have them in dirision.<br>
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,<br>
And vex them in his sore displeasure.<br>
Yet have I set my king<br>
Upon my holy hill of Zion.<br>
I will declare the decree:<br>
The LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son;<br>
This day have I begotten thee.<br>
Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,<br>
And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br>
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;<br>
Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<br>
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings:<br>
Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.<br>
Serve the LORD with fear,<br>
And rejoice with trembling.<br>
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,<br>
When his wrath is kindled but a little.<br>
Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.<br>
