Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,<br>
Nor standeth in the way of sinners,<br>
Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful<br>
But his delight is in the law of the LORD;<br>
And in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br>
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,<br>
That bringeth forth his fruit in his season;<br>
His leaf also shall not wither;<br>
And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper<br>
The ungodly are not so:<br>
But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br>
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement,<br>
Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous<br>
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous:<br>
But the way of the ungodly shall perish.<br>
