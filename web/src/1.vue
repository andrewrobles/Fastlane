Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;<br>
but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.<br>
He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.<br>
The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.<br>
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;<br>
for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.<br>
